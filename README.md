# Comparison_of_ANN_and_CNN_using_CIFAR_10_dataset
In this project, I explore the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular benchmark for image classification tasks, to understand the advantages of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in handling image data.
# Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 distinct classes, each with 6,000 images. This dataset is partitioned into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes encompass a variety of objects, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more. CIFAR-10 is widely adopted as a benchmark for evaluating image classification algorithms.

# Model Architecture
<b>ANN:</b> We construct a traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow. ANNs are known for their simplicity and versatility in handling structured data.

<b>CNN:</b> A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is developed, leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities. CNNs are specifically designed to excel in image-related tasks by capturing spatial hierarchies and local patterns.

# Conclusion
The CIFAR-10 Image Classification: ANN vs. CNN Comparison project provides valuable insights into the suitability of ANNs and CNNs for image classification tasks. By evaluating their performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we gain a deeper understanding of when and why CNNs outperform traditional ANNs in handling image data.
